# Sebastian's MAV Individual Repository
Welcome to my repository for the individual assignment of the course AE4317 Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles, 2020. This approach uses an adjusted template matching algorithm that enables a fast and reliable gate detection for autonomous racing drones.

In order to test the gate detection algorithm, please follow the following steps:
1. Download and unzip this repository.
2. Download and unzip the **WashingtonOBRace** directory, as it is on Brightspace. Place it next to the **MAV_individual-master** folder. Make sure that the original images are placed in the directory **WashingtonOBRace/WashingtonOBRace/**.
3. Open the folder [Template Matching](https://github.com/SebastianAlNi/MAV_individual/tree/master/Template_Matching)
4. Run *Template_Matching_Thresholding.py*. Make sure that OpenCV and Numpy are installed on your machine.
5. Once completed, the results can be found in the **Output** folder next to the **MAV_individual** folder. The results include mask images, the original image including marks of the matches and a combination of both.
6. Enjoy the rest of your day :)
