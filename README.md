# MAV_individual
Welcome to my repository for the individual assignment of the course Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles, 2020. This approach uses an adjusted and optimized template matching algorithm that enables an efficient and reliable gate detection for autonomous racing drones.

In order to test the gate detection algorithm, please follow the following steps:
1. Download and unzip the repository
2. Open the folder [Template Matching](https://github.com/SebastianAlNi/MAV_individual/tree/master/Test_Scripts)
3. Place the **WashingtonOBRace**, including the original images, into the same directory
4. Run *Template_Matching_Thresholding.py*
5. The results can be found in the **Output** folder.
