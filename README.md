# Sebastian's MAV Individual Repository
Welcome to my repository for the individual assignment of the course AE4317 Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles, 2020. This approach uses an adjusted template matching algorithm that enables a fast and reliable gate detection for autonomous racing drones.

In order to test the gate detection algorithm, please follow the following steps:
1. Download and unzip the repository
2. Place the **WashingtonOBRace**, including the original images, next to the **MAV_individual** folder. Do not use subfolders.
3. Open the folder [Template Matching](https://github.com/SebastianAlNi/MAV_individual/tree/master/Template_Matching)
4. Run *Template_Matching_Thresholding.py*. Make sure that OpenCV and Numpy is installed on your machine.
5. Once completed, the results can be found in the **Output** folder next to the MAV_individual folder. Results include mask images, the original image including marks of the matches and a combination of both.
6. Enjoy the rest of your day :)
