---------- NOTES ----------

Approaches:

- SIFT (non-free)

- Gate template image / Template Matching
	- Template of entire gate
	- Template of chess pattern
	- Limitations:
		- Rotated gate, small rotation due to image distortion is okay

- Find gate in image

- Deep neural network
	- Learning not good with OpenCV
	- Ask Elsa

- Hough Lines
	- Detect vertical lines
	- connect them
	- exclude lines without connections
	- add width of gate dependent on overall size (corresponding to distance)

ROC Curve:
- IoU not possible?
	- Only one rectangle per image is detected
	- So it's either true or false, therefore true = (1-false)
	- True positive ratio can never become 1 because:
		- If nothing is detected, it will be zero (bottom left)
		- If the entire image is detected, it will also become zero (bottom right)
		- It becomes only one, if all detections are within threshold, but then the false positive rate is not one
		-> Works only if several polygons are detected wout of which many can be considered false negatives (???)
		- My algorithm always only detects one polygon -> there is no "average (absolute) number of false positives per image"
	- Doe false positive ratio always have to go all the way to one?

- Compare polyongs
- Compare filled poygons
