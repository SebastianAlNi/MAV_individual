---------- NOTES ----------

Approaches:

- SIFT (non-free)

- Gate template image / Template Matching
	- Template of entire gate
	- Template of chess pattern
	- Limitations:
		- Rotated gate, small rotation due to image distortion is okay

- Find gate in image

- Deep neural network
	- Learning not good with OpenCV
	- Ask Elsa

- Hough Lines
	- Detect vertical lines
	- connect them
	- exclude lines without connections
	- add width of gate dependent on overall size (corresponding to distance)

ROC Curve:
- IoU not possible?
	- Only one rectangle per image is detected
	- So it's either true or false, therefore true = (1-false)

- Compare polyongs
- Compare filled poygons
