---------- NOTES ----------

Approaches:

- SIFT (non-free)

- Gate template image / Template Matching
	- Template of entire gate
	- Template of chess pattern

- Find gate in image

- Deep neural network
	- Learning not good with OpenCV
	- Ask Elsa

- Hough Lines
	- Detect vertical lines
	- connect them
	- exclude lines without connections
	- add width of gate dependent on overall size (corresponding to distance)
