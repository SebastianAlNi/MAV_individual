---------- NOTES ----------

Approaches:

- SIFT (non-free)

- Gate template image / Template Matching

- Find gate in image

- Deep neural network

- Hough Lines
	- Detect vertical lines
	- connect them
	- exclude lines without connections
	- add width of gate dependent on overall size (corresponding to distance)
